# ü©∏ Blood Bank Management System (SQL Project)

This is a pure SQL project that handles donor records, hospital info, and emergency blood requests. It uses basic to advanced SQL concepts like:
- Table creation with foreign keys
- Data insertion
- Aggregation, JOINs, filtering with dates

Great project for healthcare or database-focused portfolios.

## How to Use
- Run `create_tables.sql` to create the DB
- Run `insert_data.sql` to populate data
- Try queries from `queries.sql` to test use cases
